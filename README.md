# Project-ReStep
This will be a project focusing on NotITG 4.3.0 and under compatibility with stepmania 5.1
- (this project most likely won't be successful but hopefully will be a fun learning experience)
# Plans
- Function theme (similar to the NotITG theme for quick transition)
- Linux/MacOS compatibility
- USB Drive support for simfiles
- NotITG noteskin support
- OpenITG support for older files
